Step 1: Alternative Tools ResearchÂ¶

Tool one: Jenkins.io
    2: Jenkins will integrate with a LOT of different tools and services due to its vast amount of plugins.
    3: Jenkins is easy to use, integrates with lots of other softwares and services. It's complex, but that complexity is what will streamline our process down the road.
    4: Started in 2004, jenkins ha become a very popular ci service, but comes with controversy. Because of it's high customizability, it has a steep learning curve with complexity that not many users have patience for.

Tool Two: Raygun
    2: Raygun is inexpensive starting out, it gives detailed errors which even include the lines of code that gave the error, allows great filtering to see which errors occurred where, when, and how.
    3: It is well documented. It has a getting started section, as well as a Teams guide.
    4: I believe it was founded 2007, and it seems like we have a solid fanbase, it comes highly rated.
